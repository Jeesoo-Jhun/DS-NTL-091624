        "Each of the previous exercises contain a small suite of testing code that has been previously curated to allow you to immediately assess if your code is working as intended.\n",

        "However, none of them are particularly impressive when it comes to true test-driven development.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, you may have noticed that six of the seven previous exercises revolved around two Python mini-projects: **\"The Daily Bugle\"** and **\"The Krusty Krab\"**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your objective is simple: **revise _at least one (1) of the two previous challenge mini-projects' testing suites_ by using various `assert` statements to ensure that your custom scripts, functions, and objects are working as intended.**\n",
        "\n",
        "You'll notice that this challenge, unlike previous ones, is particularly ambiguous... that is because testing is largely up to the creatively analytical interpretation of the developer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your goal is to be as exhaustive and verbose as possible to ensure that your derived scripts, functions, and objects are not only doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing, but aren't comprising any nasty side effects or misappropriated behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it this way... how robust and reliable can you make your code such that another developer can't easily break it through a nasty variable input or sneaky function invocation?\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this challenge, you should see that either **The Daily Bugle** or **The Krusty Krab** now have a series of testing functions and scripts written to verify the reliability and robustness of their three interdependently functioning custom scripts that you wrote previously."
